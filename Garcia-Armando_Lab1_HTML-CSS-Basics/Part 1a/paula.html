			<p><strong>About:</strong> From <u>pentagram.com/about/paula-scher</u>, <em>For four decades Paula Scher has been at the forefront of graphic design. Described as the <q>master conjurer of the instantly familiar,</q> Scher straddles the line between pop culture and fine art in her work. Iconic, smart, and accessible, her images have entered into the American vernacular.</em> Paula Scher has taught me about technique, and also how past design can still function in today's society. Her approach to the design process is one-of-a-kind. I'm inspired by her dedication to disrupt the everyday with bright, bold, graphic emphasis.</p>
