			<p><strong>About:</strong> From <u>ellenlupton.com/about</u>, <em>Ellen Lupton is curator of contemporary design at Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City and director of the Graphic Design MFA program at Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) in Baltimore. An author of numerous books and articles on design, she is a public-minded critic, frequent lecturer, and AIGA Gold Medalist.</em> Ellen Lupton has been an inspiration to me on print and in many online classrooms. I enjoy her blend of design, writing, and education. Her combination-approach, along with her dedication to technique and typography, are a teaching force that is rarely matched.</p>
